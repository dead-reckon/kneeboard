Operation features:
- Engine has a boost mode which is engaged by setting the mixture control lever to maximum.
- Engine has a single-stage mechanical supercharger which does not require manual control.
- Engine mixture control is automatic when the mixture lever is set to the intermediate (50%) position. It is possible to manually lean the mixture by setting the control to less than 50%. This will reduce fuel consumption during flight.
- Engine RPM has an automatic governor and it is maintained at the required RPM corresponding to the governor control lever position. The governor automatically controls the propeller pitch to maintain the required RPM.
- Water and oil radiator shutter control is manual.
- Airplane has only the pitch and yaw flight-control trimmers.
- Airplane has automatic wing slats. They deploy when the high angle of attack increases which makes pre-stall softer.
- Landing flaps have a limiter for the maximum angle. The flaps have an extended range from 0° to 50°. The landing flaps have pneumatic actuator. Flaps can only be instantly extended to the angle which is set by limiter, gradual extending is impossible. Due to weak force of the actuator the extended landing flaps may retract upward by the airflow when the airspeed is more than 220 km/h. For this reason, it is necessary to remember that flaps will not extend fully in case of high speed. In case of a high-speed landing approach the flaps may extend a few steps right before landing.
- Airplane has a tailwheel control system which is unlocked and made controllable by the rudder if the rudder pedal is pressed more than for 40% of its range. The tailwheel remans locked if pedals are deflected less than 40%. Because of this, it is necessary to avoid large rudder pedal inputs when moving at high speed, or be ready to control the airplane with an unlocked tailwheel should large rudder inputs be made.
- Airplane has differential pneumatic wheel brakes with shared control lever. This means that if the brake lever is held and the rudder pedal the opposite wheel brake is gradually released causing the plane to swing to one side or the other.
- Airplane has a fuel gauge which shows total fuel remaining.
- It is impossible to open or close the canopy at high speed due to strong airflow. The canopy has no emergency release, so bail out requires the speed drop before it.
- When bombs are installed a salvo controller can be used, it has two release modes: single drop or drop two in a salvo.
- When rockets are installed a salvo controller can be used, it has three launch modes: single fire, fire two in a salvo or fire four in a salvo.

- Water and oil radiator shutter control is manual.
- Airplane has trimmers for all flight-controls: pitch, roll, yaw.
- Airplane has fence-type airbrakes which are located under the wing and used to slow the descent during steep dive bombing.
- Landing flaps have electro-hydraulic actuator and they can be extended to any angle up to 50°. When landing and the flaps are fully extended the angle of attack for a stall is less than landing pitch angle. For this reason, it is prohibited to extend flaps to more than to 35° (70%) on landing.
- Airplane has automatically controlled horizontal stabilizer. The automatic control system adjusts the stabilizer angle depending on landing flaps extended angle.
- Airplane tail wheel rotates freely and does not have a lock. For this reason, it is necessary to confidently and accurately operate the rudder pedals during the takeoff and landing.
- Airplane has differential pneumatic wheel brakes with shared control lever. This means that if the brake lever is held and the rudder pedal the opposite wheel brake is gradually released causing the plane to swing to one side or the other.
- Airplane has three fuel gauges which shows the level in the fuselage fuel tank, left wing tanks and right wing tanks.
- Cockpit canopy have an emergency release system for bailouts.
- Airplane is equipped with a bomb salvo controller, it has four release modes: drop single, drop two in a salvo, drop four in a salvo or drop all bombs in salvo. There is also a controller for a drop delay between each bomb in the salvo.
- When rockets are installed a salvo controller can be used, it has three launch modes: single fire, fire two in a salvo or fire four in a salvo. Aircraft has a fire control system that is designed for eight rockets. However, for added punch, ten rockets were typically loaded. In that case, the ninth rocket will fire with the seventh and the tenth will fire with the eighth.

Operation features:
- Engine has a two-stage mechanical supercharger which must be manually switched at 2500m altitude.
- Engine mixture control is manual, it is necessary to lean the mixture if altitude is more than 3-4 km for optimal engine operation. Also, leaning the mixture allows a reduction in fuel consumption during flight.
- Engine RPM has an automatic governor and it is maintained at the required RPM corresponding to the governor control lever position. The governor automatically controls the propeller pitch to maintain the required RPM.
- Water and oil radiator shutters is manually controlled.
- Airplane has trimmers for all flight-controls: pitch, roll, yaw.
- Landing flaps have a hydraulic actuator and they can be extended to any angle up to 60°.
- Airplane tail wheel rotates freely and does not have a lock. For this reason, it is necessary to confidently and accurately operate the rudder pedals during the takeoff and landing.
- Airplane has differential pneumatic wheel brakes with shared control lever. This means that if the brake lever is held and the rudder pedal the opposite wheel brake is gradually released causing the plane to swing to one side or the other.
- Airplane has a fuel gauge which shows total remaining fuel.
- Cockpit canopy has a weak lock when in the opened position, for this reason the canopy may spontaneously close in a deep dive. Also, it is impossible to open or close canopy at high speed due to strong airflow. The canopy has no emergency release, so bail out requires the speed drop before it.
- The control system of wing-mounted bomb racks only allows the dropping of bombs one by one.
- When rockets are installed a salvo controller is used, it has three launch modes: single fire, fire two in a salvo or fire four in a salvo.

Operation features:
- Airplane has a wide automatization of the engine systems, in fact, to control speed it is only necessary to use the throttle lever. There is no need to manually set engine revolutions and mixture or supercharger gear in normal flight.
- In addition to full-automatic mode there is a special manual control mode for the radiator shutters, which can be used in specific situations.
- To reduce swinging during taxiing due to prop-wash the propeller pitch control should be switched to manual mode and pitch should be reduced to minimum.
- Airplane has no flight-control trimmers. Airplane is equipped with bendable trim tabs that can be set pre-flight by ground personnel.
- Airplane has a manually controlled horizontal stabilizer. It should be set to +1° before takeoff and to -4°...-5° before landing. Also, it may be used to trim the flight stick during the flight. In a deep dive the stabilizer should be set so that the pilot must push the flight stick forward to maintain the dive angle.
- Airplane has automatic wing slats. They deploy when the high angle of attack increases which makes pre-stall softer.
- Airplane has a manual mechanical system for retracting the landing flaps, for this reason it is necessary to extend landing flaps well before final approach. Markers on the left-wing flap indicate how far the flaps are extended. The flaps can be extended to any angle up to 40°.
- Airplane has a manual tail wheel lock. Wheel should be locked when taxiing straight for a long distance and before takeoff and landing.
- Airplane has independent left and right hydraulic wheel brake controls. To apply either brake push the upper part of the rudder pedal.
- Airplane has a fuel gauge which shows total fuel remaining. Also, it has an emergency fuel warning light (80 liters).
- The design of the cockpit canopy does not allow it to be opened during flight. The canopy should be closed before takeoff to prevent damage. The canopy has an emergency release system for bailouts.
- The control system for the bomb rack only allows for dropping bombs one by one.
- The gunsight has a sliding sun-filter.

Operation features:
- Engine has a two-stage mechanical supercharger which must be manually switched at 2000 m altitude.
- Engine mixture control is manual; it is necessary to lean the mixture if altitude is more than 3-4 km for optimal engine operation. Also, leaning the mixture allows a reduction in fuel consumption during flight.
- Engine RPM has an automatic governor and it is maintained at the required RPM corresponding to the governor control lever position. The governor automatically controls the propeller pitch to maintain the required RPM.
- Water and oil radiator shutters are controlled manually.
- Airplane has only the pitch flight-control trimmer.
- Landing flaps have a pneumatic actuator. Flaps can only be fully extended; gradual extending is impossible. Due to the weak force of the actuator the extended landing flaps may be pressed upwards by the airflow if the airspeed is more than 250 km/h. Remember that the flaps will not extend fully in case of high speed. In case of a high-speed landing approach the flaps may extend a few steps further right before landing.
- Airplane has a manual control for the tailwheel lock. The unlocked tailwheel has a 90° turn limit. The tailwheel should be locked when taxiing straight for a long distance and before takeoff and landing.
- Airplane has differential pneumatic wheel brakes with shared control lever. This means that if the brake lever is held and the rudder pedal the opposite wheel brake is gradually released causing the plane to swing to one side or the other.
- Fuel gauges are installed on left and right wing fuel tanks, outside of the cockpit. They show remaining fuel level only when there is less than 130 liters of fuel left in the tank.
- It is impossible to open or close the canopy at high speed due to strong airflow. The canopy has no emergency release, so bail out requires the speed drop before it.
- The control system for the wing-mounted bomb racks only allows releasing of both bombs together.

Operation features:
- Engine has a boost mode which is engaged by setting mixture control lever to maximum position.
- Engine has a single stage mechanical supercharger which does not require manual control.
- Engine mixture control is automatic when the mixture lever is set to the intermediate (50%) position. It is possible to manually lean the mixture by moving the control lever to less than 50%. This will lower fuel consumption during flight.
- Engine RPM has an automatic governor and it is maintained at the required RPM corresponding to the governor control lever position. The governor automatically controls the propeller pitch to maintain the required RPM.
- Water and oil radiator shutter control is manual. Airplane has armored oil radiator shutters which should be closed at the beginning of ground attack to reduce a possibility of combat damage. After finishing the attack, it is necessary to re-open the shutters to the required position.
- Airplane has only the pitch flight-control trimmer.
- Landing flaps have a pneumatic actuator. Flaps can be extended fully or to takeoff position - 17°, gradual extending is impossible. Due to the weak force of the actuator the extended landing flaps may be pressed upwards by the airflow if the airspeed is more than 220 km/h. Remember that the flaps will not extend fully in case of high speed. In case of a high-speed landing approach the flaps may extend a few steps further right before the landing which will cause the aircraft to shoot upwards.
- Airplane has a manual tail wheel lock. Wheel should be locked when taxiing straight for a long distance and before takeoff and landing.
- Airplane has differential pneumatic wheel brakes with shared control lever. This means that if the brake lever is held and the rudder pedal the opposite wheel brake is gradually released causing the plane to swing to one side or the other.
- Airplane has a fuel gauge which shows the amount of remaining fuel in the front or bottom fuel tank depending on switch position. In game the fuel indicator switch changes by itself during horizontal flight by every 10 seconds. Rear fuel tank level is not indicated.
- Cockpit canopy weight is 50 kg and it has no lock in the open position, for this reason the canopy may to spontaneously close in a deep dive. Also, it is impossible to open or close canopy at high speed due to strong airflow. The canopy has no emergency release, so bail out requires the speed drop before it.
- Airplane is equipped with a joint salvo controller both for bombs and rockets, it has three release/fire modes: single launch, launch two in a salvo or launch four in a salvo.
- The mechanical gun sight "Visier Vladimirova" allows aiming rockets and guns at ground and air targets and horizontal bombing at certain speeds and altitudes.

Operation features:
- Airplane has a wide automatization of the engine systems, in fact, to control speed it is only necessary to use the throttle lever. There is no need to manually set engine revolutions and mixture or supercharger gear in normal flight. The engine supercharger has an automatic switch system which depends on altitude and engine revolutions.
- U17 strike modification includes C3 additional fuel injection system. When engaged, it increases pressure to 1.65 ATA (10 minutes time limit). This system can be turned on by engine boost command only at 100% throttle, with automatic propeller pitch control enabled and at altitudes lower than 1 km.
- Outlet cowl shutters are operated manually.
- To reduce swinging during taxiing due to prop-wash the propeller pitch control should be switched to manual mode and pitch should be reduced to minimum.
- When the angle of attack increases to critical levels the wing may stall suddenly and unexpectedly. There is almost no pre-stall buffet before the stalling. To avoid this the pilot must pay additional attention when performing extreme maneuvering.
- Airplane has no flight-control trimmers. Airplane is equipped with bendable trim tabs that can be set pre-flight by ground personnel.
- Airplane has a manually controlled horizontal stabilizer which is electrically-actuated. It should be set to +1.5° before takeoff and landing. Also, it may be used to trim the flight stick during the flight. In a deep dive the stabilizer should be set so that the pilot must push the flight stick forward to maintain the dive angle.
- Airplane has electrically-actuated landing flaps with three fixed positions: retracted, takeoff (13°) and landing (58°). Flaps control buttons and indicator lights are located on left panel near the throttle. The flap angle may also be checked by indicators on the left and right wing outside the cockpit.
- Airplane has a tail wheel lock system which locks the tail wheel if the flight-stick is pulled backward. The tailwheel should be locked when taxiing straight for a long distance, before takeoff and after touchdown upon landing.
- Airplane has independent left and right hydraulic wheel brake controls. To apply either brake push the upper part of the rudder pedal.
- Airplane has a fuel gauge which shows the amount of remaining fuel in the front or rear fuel tank depending on switch position. In game the fuel indicator switch changes by itself during horizontal flight by every 10 seconds. Also, the airplane has an emergency fuel warning light (100 liters).
- It is impossible to open or close the canopy at high speed due to strong airflow. The canopy has an emergency release system for bailouts.
- The control system for the bomb rack only allows for dropping bombs one by one.
- The gunsight has a sliding sun-filter.

Operation features:
- Engine is equipped with the automatic governor of the manifold pressure that works when the throttle is set to 1/3 position or above.
- Engine has a two stage mechanical supercharger which does not require manual control. It can be switched to the low gear manually.
- Engine is equipped with an automatic fuel mixture control which maintains optimal mixture if mixture lever is set to the forward position. It is possible to manually lean the mixture by moving the mixture control to less than maximum. This also reduces fuel consumption during flight.
- Engine RPM has an automatic governor that controls the propeller pitch to maintain the required RPM.
- The water and oil radiators shutters are operated automatically, but there is a special manual mode that forces radiator shutters to open completely.
- Aircraft has a neutral static stability. The elevator effectiveness is high, so the aircraft should be controlled carefully, not giving too much flight stick input.
- Aircraft becomes unstable with extended landing flaps.
- Aircraft is equipped with elevator and rudder trimmers.
- Landing flaps have a pneumatic actuator so they can be extended to maximum position only. Speed with extended landing flaps is limited to 140 mph.
- Airplane tail wheel rotates freely and does not have a lock. Since the landing gear wheels are relatively close to each other, it is necessary to confidently and accurately operate the rudder pedals during the takeoff and landing.
- Airplane has differential pneumatic wheel brakes with shared control lever. This means that if the brake lever is held and the rudder pedal the opposite wheel brake is gradually released causing the plane to swing to one side or the other.
- Airplane is equipped with a siren that warns a pilot if the throttle is set to low position with landing gear retracted.
- It is impossible to open or close the canopy at high speed due to strong airflow. The canopy has an emergency release system for bailouts.
- The aircraft is equipped with a bottom formation light.
- Standard gunsight is adjustable: both the target distance and target base can be set.
- The gyroscopic gunsight automaticly calculates required angular deflection while firing at a target. It has 4 modes: fixed reticle, fixed and gyro reticle, gyro reticle, gyro reticle with the target range fixed at 150 yards (night mode). The angular deflection will be calculated correctly only if the target range is set properly. To set the range, adjust the target base first using separate controls and then set the range by adjusting the size of the rangefiding reticle to be the same as the target size.
- Both gunsights have sliding sun-filters.

Operation features:
- In addition to the automatic single stage supercharger, the engine is equipped with a turbocharger that the pilot can control.
- The turbocharger is powered by the engine exhaust back pressure which can be set by a lever in the cockpit and maintained automatically using the throttle shutters on the exhaust pipes.
- The air compressed in the turbocharger goes to the intercooler where it is cooled by the incoming airflow. The cool compressed air goes to the carburetor and the resulting fuel-air mixture goes to the supercharger.
- The temperature of the air after the intercooler is indicated by a separate gauge. The pilot can control the intercooler flaps using the toggle switch and observe their position using the indicator on the left. Their default position is neutral (50%).
- The turbocharger RPM is controlled by the lever in the cockpit ("T" and "+"/"-" keys by default). At the back lever position the throttle shutters are fully open and exhaust gases all go to the atmosphere, resulting in minimal turbocharger RPM. At the forward lever position, the exhaust back pressure and the resulting turbocharger RPM are at maximum. It should be noted that the RPM will change with the altitude even if the lever is kept in the same position. The turbocharger RPM is indicated by a dedicated gauge; in addition, the signal lamp will light up if the maximum RPM limit is exceeded.
- The total engine power should be controlled using the joint method when the three levers - RPM lever, throttle lever and turbocharger lever are moved together. However, in certain cases (for instance, when going higher than the critical altitude) the turbocharger lever should be adjusted separately.
- It should be noted that turbocharger RPM changes relatively slowly and not immediately after the control lever adjustment.
- The aircraft is equipped with the water injection system that boosts the power in the emergency mode. When this system is engaged, the exhaust back pressure and turbocharger RPM increase automatically while the mixture becomes leaner. The water supply is good for around 15 minutes at the emergency power.
- The engine is equipped with an automatic fuel mixture control which maintains optimal mixture if the mixture lever is set to Auto Rich (85%) position. To use automatic mixture leaning to reduce fuel consumption during flight it is necessary to set the mixture lever to Auto Lean (60%) position. In the case of malfunction of the automatic mixture control the mixture lever should be set to Full Rich (100%) position. To stop the engine mixture lever should be set to the Cut Off (0%) position.
- Engine RPM has an automatic governor and it is maintained at the required RPM corresponding to the governor control lever position. The governor automatically controls the propeller pitch to maintain the required RPM. Also, it is possible to turn off the governor and control propeller pitch manually.
- Oil radiators shutters are manually operated.
- The aircraft has trimmers for all flight-controls: pitch, roll and yaw.
- Landing flaps have a hydraulic actuator and they can be extended to any angle up to 40°.
- It is forbidden to open the cowl flaps at speeds exceeding 225 mph, perform sharp maneuvers with the opened cowl shutters and dive with the opened intercooler shutters.
- The aircraft has a manual control for the tailwheel lock. The tailwheel should be locked when taxiing straight for a long distance and before takeoff and landing.
- The aircraft has independent left and right hydraulic wheel brake controls. To apply either brake push the upper part of the rudder pedal.
- The aircraft is equipped with a parking brake system.
- The signal lamp lights up when the landing gear is up and the throttle is in the backward position or when the landing gear is down, but the throttle is in the forward position.
- It should be noted that the aircraft requires a long takeoff run - around 650 meters at standard load and 1500 meters at maximum takeoff weight. It is possible to lower the flaps to 10-20 degrees to shorten the takeoff run.
- The aircraft is equipped with one fuel gauge, but two indicator needles for the forward and rear fuel tanks.
- The engine consumes much fuel at the combat power mode - around 4.5 gallons per minute.
- The canopy has an emergency release system for bailouts.
- The aircraft is equipped with the manual bomb release system for each of the three bomb racks.
- The unguided rockets are launched using the electric controller which allows single, pair, triple and salvo (all rockets at 0.1 seconds interval) launch.
- There is a backup mechanical sight which can be used if the main sight is damaged.
- The gyroscopic gunsight automatically calculates required angular deflection while firing at a target. It has 3 modes: fixed reticle, fixed and gyro reticle, gyro reticle. The angular deflection will be calculated correctly only if the target range is set properly. To set the range, adjust the target base first using separate controls and then set the range by adjusting the size of the range-finding reticle to be the same as the target size.

Operation features:
- Airplane has a wide automatization of the engine systems, in fact, to control speed it is only necessary to use the throttle lever. There is no need to manually set engine revolutions and mixture or supercharger gear in normal flight.
- The aircraft is equipped with MW-50 water-methanol mixture injection system that prevents the engine detonation in the emergency power mode. It engages automatically when the throttle is set to maximum, there is enough mixture for 25-30 minutes. However, the engine can work up to 10 minutes at this mode, wait for another 10 minutes at the combat mode before engaging the emergency mode again. Attention: running the engine at the emergency mode without the water-methanol mixture or at altitudes higher than 6 km is forbidden! A pilot can check the system using the injection pressure indicator on the left: its normal pressure is 0.6...0.7 atm, stop using it if the pressure is lower than 0.4 atm and switch the engine to combat mode.
- In addition to full-automatic mode there is a special manual control mode for the radiator shutters, which can be used in specific situations.
- To reduce swinging during taxiing due to prop-wash the propeller pitch control should be switched to manual mode and pitch should be reduced to minimum.
- Airplane has no flight-control trimmers. Airplane is equipped with bendable trim tabs that can be set pre-flight by ground personnel.
- Airplane has a manually controlled horizontal stabilizer. It should be set to +1° before takeoff and to -4°...-5° before landing. Also, it may be used to trim the flight stick during the flight. In a deep dive the stabilizer should be set so that the pilot must push the flight stick forward to maintain the dive angle.
- Airplane has automatic wing slats. They deploy when the high angle of attack increases which makes pre-stall softer.
- Airplane has a manual mechanical system for retracting the landing flaps, for this reason it is necessary to extend landing flaps well before final approach. Markers on the left-wing flap indicate how far the flaps are extended. The flaps can be extended to any angle up to 40°.
- Airplane has a manual tail wheel lock. Wheel should be locked when taxiing straight for a long distance and before takeoff and landing.
- Airplane has independent left and right hydraulic wheel brake controls. To apply either brake push the upper part of the rudder pedal.
- Airplane has a fuel gauge which shows total fuel remaining. Also, it has an emergency fuel warning light (80 liters).
- The design of the cockpit canopy does not allow it to be opened during flight. The canopy should be closed before takeoff to prevent damage. The canopy has an emergency release system for bailouts.
- The control system for the bomb rack only allows to drop bombs one by one.
- The gunsight has a sliding sun-filter.

Operation features:
- Airplane has a wide automatization of the engine systems, in fact, to control speed it is only necessary to use the throttle lever. There is no need to manually set engine revolutions and mixture or supercharger gear in normal flight. The engine supercharger has an automatic switch system which depends on altitude and engine revolutions.
- There is an additional emergency engine mode system installed. When it is engaged, the first supercharger gear pressure increases to 1.58 ATA and the second gear pressure to 1.65 ATA, the time limit is 10 minutes. This system is turned on by the engine boost command and works only when the throttle is set to 100%, automatic propeller pitch system is engaged and the altitude is lower than critical altitude for a given supercharger gear.
- Outlet cowl shutters are operated manually.
- To reduce swinging during taxiing due to prop-wash the propeller pitch control should be switched to manual mode and pitch should be reduced to minimum.
- When the angle of attack increases to critical levels the wing may stall suddenly and unexpectedly. There is almost no pre-stall buffet before the stalling. To avoid this the pilot must pay additional attention when performing extreme maneuvering.
- Airplane has no flight-control trimmers. Airplane is equipped with bendable trim tabs that can be set pre-flight by ground personnel.
- Airplane has a manually controlled horizontal stabilizer which is electrically-actuated. It should be set to +1.5° before takeoff and landing. Also, it may be used to trim the flight stick during the flight. In a deep dive the stabilizer should be set so that the pilot must push the flight stick forward to maintain the dive angle.
- Airplane has electrically-actuated landing flaps with three fixed positions: retracted, takeoff (13°) and landing (58°). Flaps control buttons are located on left panel near the throttle. The flap angle may be checked by indicators on the left and right wing outside the cockpit.
- Airplane has a tail wheel lock system which locks the tail wheel if the flight-stick is pulled backward. The tailwheel should be locked when taxiing straight for a long distance, before takeoff and after touchdown upon landing.
- Airplane has independent left and right hydraulic wheel brake controls. To apply either brake push the upper part of the rudder pedal.
- Airplane has a fuel gauge which shows the amount of remaining fuel in the front or rear fuel tank depending on switch position. In game the fuel indicator switch changes by itself during horizontal flight by every 10 seconds. Also, the airplane has an emergency fuel warning light (100 liters).
- It is impossible to open or close the canopy at high speed due to strong airflow. The canopy has an emergency release system for bailouts.
- The standard bomb release controller (without modification) allows dropping the bombs only one by one. The strike modification (F-8) bomb release controller allows to choose the bomb release order for underbelly and underwing bombs and the delay between each bomb in the salvo.
- The gunsight has a sliding sun-filter.

Story:
The SPAD S.XIII was designed as an improved version of the SPAD S.VII. While appearing externally similar to its predecessor, it was in fact a completely new design. A second machine gun and more a powerful engine were fitted. In addition, an auxiliary fuel tank was placed in the central section of the upper wing. The main fuel tank had outlines of the lower fuselage section. To the left and behind the cockpit was an installation for a reconnaissance camera or a bomb load. The aircraft’s first flight was made on the 4th of April 1917. The plane was manufactured by Bleriot, Levasseur, Bernard, Kellner, Safca, Borel, and Nieuport. In all, 8472 planes of the type were built.
The S.XIII first appeared at the front in late summer-early fall 1917, being initially supplied to French fighter squadrons. It was mainly used for engaging enemy planes, escorting bombers, aerial mapping, and recon; rarely was it used for the bombing of ground targets near the front lines.
French pilots were eager to receive the S.XIII. The second machine gun provided increased firepower, and the new engine allowed it to fly and climb faster than its predecessors. Its controls remained effective even at high altitudes. The only remaining drawback, owing to its thin wing profile, was its decreased sensitivity of controls at low speeds, which often resulted in a stall. In a dive and level flight, the SPAD S.XIII was one of the fastest aircraft of its time. Pilots who flew it remarked, “It dives faster than the wind!” It participated in battles on all fronts during WWI. French, British, American and Italian units were all equipped with the type.

Story:
The Sopwith Camel's construction was based on that of its predecessor, the Sopwith Pup. Sopwith's chief designer Herbert Smith decided to somewhat alter the Pup’s design, since a newarger and heavier engine would have to be mounted. Some changes were made to theanding gear struts, the spacing of the wings and stabiliser were increased, and the fuselage acquired an extension to the cockpit's trailing edge, whichooked ratherike a camel’s hump. That 'hump' is what gave the plane its name - the Sopwith Camel.
A remarkable detail of the plane’s construction was its compactness: the pilot’s seat, fuel tanks, machine guns and engine were all installed very close together. In parallel with the work of the main Sopwith factory, the plane was also assembled by a number of other companies such as Ruston Proctor Co, Portholme Aerodrome Ltd, Boulton & Paul Ltd, British Caudron Co. Ltd, Clayton & Shuttleworth Ltd, Hooper & Co. Ltd and others. In total, about 5490 Camels were built. The Camel’s first flight trials were performed by the British No. 60 squadron in March of 1917, which were followed by a series of minor improvements to the plane’s construction. Production aircraft were first delivered to fighter squadrons in May of 1917. It was primarily used for destroying enemy aircraft and balloons, while from time to time it was also engaged in ground attack operations. English journalists referred to this plane as a “small and agile beast.”
Camel pilots mentioned the plane’s well-balanced flight controls, the good upward view, and the high cruising speed. Due to the aircraft's unique balance, the plane could almost instantly change its heading, which made the Camel a dangerous opponent. The typical combat scenario for the Camel pilot was a dogfight at low and medium altitudes, where the Camel had the advantage in steep turns. Veterans were known to say, “Once you become a Camel pilot, you will fly it forever.” In addition to equipping British units, this plane was also piloted by four American squadrons of the U.S. Air Service and by some Belgian pilots.

Story:
In the spring of 1917, during a visit to Jasta 11, Anthony Fokker inspected the construction of a captured British fighter, the Sopwith Triplane. Manfred von Richthofen related to Fokker the details of his dogfight with this new aeroplane. It was only due to his great experience that the Red Baron managed to avoid defeat.
The prototype of the F.I (the name at the time of the Dr.I) triplane was made ready by August 1917. Some remarkable details of its construction were as follows: a steel tube fuselage frame, as well as metal frames for the stabilizer and tail fin; an absence of bracing trusses; and the placement of the ailerons on the upper wing. The plane was more compact and robust than the British Sopwith Triplane. In total, 320 Dr.I triplanes were built.
On the 23rd of September 1917, Werner Voss shot down two British fighters while piloting an experimental version of the plane. Soon afterwards, he was attacked by six SE5s of the Royal Flying Corps. Each British plane was damaged in the course of this dramatic and historic fight, which forced two of their number to retire from the battle. It was only because he was outnumbered that the ace Voss unfortunately lost his life.
By October 1917, the first production Fokker Dr.I planes were being delivered to fighter squadrons.
The Fokker Dr.I triplane was a superb fighter, but it was rarely used to cover two-seater recon planes.
Dr.I pilots reported an excellent rate of climb and manoeuvrability and a good view from the cockpit. Pilots reported, "You need only a light touch to swing this plane around!” Thanks to these features, the triplane pilot could decide whether to disengage from an attacking enemy or to attack an enemy plane. It could engage on even terms the king of the dogfight, the British Sopwith Camel, with a good chance of victory.
RFC pilots were especially apprehensive of situations where the Fokker Dr.I and the Albatros D.Va were flying together in combat formation. The Fokkers would initiate the dogfight and the Albatros pilots would shoot down enemy planes attempting to disengage and leave the battle.
By the spring of 1918, the plane was obsolete. Only the most outstanding German aces, masterfully piloting the plane and sharpshooting their enemies, continued to fly the triplane in combat.

Story:
The Pfalz D.III was designed by Pfalz Flugzeugwerke. German engineers were impressed by the famous French Nieuport fighters, which were designed with “one-and-a-half” wings. As such, Pfalz’s design was based on the achievements of French engineers. The first trial flight was carried out in May 1917. The plane’s design featured machine guns mounted on the sides of the engine and aileron control wires situated in the lower wing. Half a year later, the Pfalz D.IIIa was introduced. It featured a more powerful engine, a larger tail fin, a modified shape of the lower wing and machine guns mounted at the pilot's line of sight. In all, 1010 Pfalz D.III and Pfalz D.IIIa aircraft were built.
In June 1917, the first Pfalz D.IIIs entered service with combat squadrons. The plane was used for bomber escort and for engaging enemy fighters and balloons. Pilots noted its exceptional cockpit visibility, good manoeuvrability, and stability when firing the machine guns; speed and climb rate were described as good. Some pilots claimed that its control sensitivity was even better than that of the Albatros D.V. Its structural durability permitted steep dives in combat and successful forced landings. English and French pilots claimed that one could shoot it down only when seriously wounding or killing the pilot. Its flight characteristics improved slightly when the Mercedes D.IIIa engine was fitted. The plane participated in battles over the Western and the Turkish fronts.

Operation features:
- Engine has a boost mode. To set boost mode it is necessary to push the boost knob and increase manifold pressure to 1140 mm Hg.
- Engine has a two-stage mechanical supercharger which must be manually switched at 3500m altitude.
- Engine mixture control is automatic when the mixture lever is set to maximum. It is possible to manually lean the mixture by moving the mixture control to less than maximum. This also reduces fuel consumption during flight.
- Engine RPM has an automatic governor and it is maintained at the required RPM corresponding to the governor control lever position. The governor automatically controls the propeller pitch to maintain the required RPM.
- Oil radiator, air cooling intake and outlet shutters is manually controlled.
- Air cooling intake shutters should always be open. They should only be closed when there is a possibility of engine overcooling, for example in a dive with idle throttle.
- Airplane has trimmers for all flight-controls: pitch, roll, yaw.
- Airplane has automatic wing slats. They deploy when the high angle of attack increases which makes pre-stall softer.
- Landing flaps have a hydraulic actuator and they can be extended to any angle up to 60°.
- Airplane tail wheel rotates freely and does not have a lock. For this reason, it is necessary to confidently and accurately operate the rudder pedals during the takeoff and landing.
- Airplane has differential pneumatic wheel brakes with shared control lever. This means that if the brake lever is held and the rudder pedal the opposite wheel brake is gradually released causing the plane to swing to one side or the other.
- Airplane has a fuel gauge which shows total remaining fuel.
- Cockpit canopy has a weak lock when in the opened position, for this reason the canopy may spontaneously close in a deep dive. Also, it is impossible to open or close canopy at high speed due to strong airflow. The canopy has no emergency release, so bail out requires the speed drop before it.
- The control system of wing-mounted bomb racks only allows the dropping of bombs one by one.

Operation features:
- The engine has a boost mode. To engage it, increase the manifold pressure to 1180 mm Hg. Boost only works on 1st supercharger gear.
- Engine has a two-stage mechanical supercharger which must be manually switched at 3500m altitude.
- Engine RPM has an automatic governor and it is maintained at the required RPM corresponding to the governor control lever position. The governor automatically controls the propeller pitch to maintain the required RPM.
- Oil radiator, air cooling intake and outlet shutters are manually controlled.
- Air cooling intake shutters should always be open. They should only be closed when there is a possibility of engine overcooling, for example in a dive with idle throttle.
- Aircraft is equipped with elevator and rudder trimmers.
- Airplane has automatic wing slats. They deploy when the high angle of attack increases which makes pre-stall softer.
- Landing flaps have a hydraulic actuator and they can be extended to any angle up to 60°.
- Airplane tail wheel rotates freely and does not have a lock. For this reason, it is necessary to confidently and accurately operate the rudder pedals during the takeoff and landing.
- Airplane has differential pneumatic wheel brakes with shared control lever. This means that if the brake lever is held and the rudder pedal the opposite wheel brake is gradually released causing the plane to swing to one side or the other.
- Airplane has a fuel gauge which shows total remaining fuel.
- Also, it is impossible to open or close canopy at high speed due to strong airflow. The canopy has no emergency release, so bail out requires the speed drop before it.
- The control system for the bomb rack only allows to drop bombs one by one.

Operation features:
- Engine has a two-stage mechanical supercharger which must be manually switched at 2300m altitude.
- Engine mixture control is manual; it is necessary to lean the mixture if altitude is more than 3-4 km for optimal engine operation. Also, leaning the mixture allows a reduction in fuel consumption during flight.
- Engine RPM has an automatic governor and it is maintained at the required RPM corresponding to the governor control lever position. The governor automatically controls the propeller pitch to maintain the required RPM.
- Water and oil radiator shutter control is manual.
- Airplane has only a flight-control trimmer on the pitch.
- Landing flaps have a pneumatic actuator. Flaps can only be fully extended; gradual extending is impossible. Due to the weak force of the actuator the extended landing flaps may be pressed upwards by the airflow if the airspeed is more than 220 km/h. Remember that the flaps will not extend fully in case of high speed. In case of a high-speed landing approach the flaps may extend a few steps further right before landing.
- Airplane has a tailwheel control system which is unlocked by the rudder if the rudder pedal is pressed more than 75% of its range. The tailwheel remains locked if pedals are deflected less than 75%. Because of this, it is necessary to avoid large rudder pedal inputs when moving at high speed.
- Airplane has differential pneumatic wheel brakes with shared control lever. This means that if the brake lever is held and the rudder pedal the opposite wheel brake is gradually released causing the plane to swing to one side or the other.
- Fuel gauges are installed on left and right wing fuel tanks, outside of the cockpit. They show remaining fuel level only when there is less than 80 liters of fuel left in the tank.
- It is impossible to open or close the canopy at high speed due to strong airflow. The canopy has no emergency release, so bail out requires the speed drop before it.
- The control system for the wing-mounted bomb racks only allows releasing of both bombs together.

Operation features:
- Engine has no manifold pressure automatic governor. For this reason, manifold pressure not only depends on throttle position, but also from RPM and altitude. This requires additional checking of manifold pressure to not cause engine damage.
- Engine has a single-stage mechanical supercharger which does not require manual control.
- Engine is equipped with an automatic fuel mixture control which maintains optimal mixture if mixture lever is set to Auto Rich (66%) position. To use automatic mixture leaning to reduce fuel consumption during flight it is necessary to set mixture lever to Auto Lean (33%) position. In the case of mulfunction of the automatic mixture control the mixture lever should be set to Full Rich (100%) position. To stop the engine mixture lever should be set to the Cut Off (0%) position.
- Engine RPM has an automatic governor and it is maintained at the required RPM corresponding to the governor control lever position. The governor automatically controls the propeller pitch to maintain the required RPM. Also it is possible to turn off the governor and control propeller pitch manually.
- Water and oil radiators shutters are joint with engine cowl outlet shutters and manually operated.
- Airplane has a very small stability margin in yaw. When angle of side slip is more than 12° plane becomes unstable in yaw and starts to increase the side slip angle by itself. Because of this, it is necessary to accurately operate the rudder pedals and pay attention to the side slip indicator.
- Airplane has trimmers for all flight-controls: pitch, roll, yaw.
- Landing flaps have a hydraulic actuator and they can be extended to any angle up to 45°.
- Airplane has a tailwheel control system which is unlocked by the rudder if the rudder pedal is pressed more than half of its range. The tailwheel remains locked if pedals are deflected less than half way. Because of this, it is necessary to avoid large rudder pedal inputs when moving at high speed.
- Airplane has independent left and right hydraulic wheel brakes. To brake it is necessary to push upper part of the rudder pedal.
- Airplane is equipped with a parking brake system.
- Airplane has three fuel gauges which shows the level in each fuel tank.
- It is impossible to open or close canopy at high speed due to strong airflow. The canopy has an emergency release system for bail out.
- Airplane is equipped with mechanical releasing system for a single bomb.
- When rockets are installed a salvo controller can be used, it has three launch modes: single fire, fire two in a salvo or fire four in a salvo.
- The gunsight has a sliding sun-filter. There is also a back-up mechanical sight which can be used if main sight is damaged.

Operation features:
- Airplane has a wide automatization of the engine systems, in fact, to control speed it is only necessary to use the throttle lever. There is no need to manually set engine revolutions and mixture or supercharger gear in normal flight.
- In addition to full-automatic mode there is a special manual control mode for the radiator shutters, which can be used in specific situations.
- To reduce swinging during taxiing due to prop-wash the propeller pitch control should be switched to manual mode and pitch should be reduced to minimum.
- Airplane has no flight-control trimmers. Airplane is equipped with bendable trim tabs that can be set pre-flight by ground personnel.
- Airplane has a manually controlled horizontal stabilizer. It should be set to +1° before takeoff and to -4°...-5° before landing. Also, it may be used to trim the flight stick during the flight. In a deep dive the stabilizer should be set so that the pilot must push the flight stick forward to maintain the dive angle.
- Airplane has automatic wing slats. They deploy when the high angle of attack increases which makes pre-stall softer.
- Airplane has a manual mechanical system for retracting the landing flaps, for this reason it is necessary to extend landing flaps well before final approach. Markers on the left-wing flap indicate how far the flaps are extended. The flaps can be extended to any angle up to 40°.
- Airplane has a manual tail wheel lock. Wheel should be locked when taxiing straight for a long distance and before takeoff and landing.
- Airplane has independent left and right hydraulic wheel brake controls. To apply either brake push the upper part of the rudder pedal.
- Airplane has a fuel gauge which shows total fuel remaining. Also, it has an emergency fuel warning light (80 liters).
- The design of the cockpit canopy does not allow it to be opened during flight. The canopy should be closed before takeoff to prevent damage. The canopy has an emergency release system for bailouts.
- The control system for the bomb rack only allows to drop bombs one by one.
- The gunsight has a sliding sun-filter.

Operation features:
- Engine has a single stage mechanical supercharger which does not require manual control.
- Engine mixture control is manual; it is necessary to lean the mixture if altitude is more than 1 km for optimal engine operation. Also, leaning the mixture allows a reduction in fuel consumption during flight.
- All three propellers are fixed pitch ones, so thrust can only be controlled by adjusting the engines throttle (from idle at 25% to maximum power at 100%). 0 - 20% throttle range is used for braking the landing gear wheels. Engine modes can be determined only by watching the engine RPM gauges.
- Radiator bypass valve and engine cowls are controlled manually.
- Pedals in the cabin are equipped with adjustable load feel mechanism to reduce the pilot's work load.
- Airplane has a manually controlled horizontal stabilizer. It should be set to 0° before takeoff, to +2° during flight and to -1.5° for landing. Also, it may be used to trim the flight stick during the flight.
- The mechanical flaps control system can be controlled simultaneously with the horizontal stabilizer, these two systems can be linked or unlinked (by using flaps control buttons). It is important to note that it is possible to render the system inoperable so it would not be able to control either the stabilizer or the flaps by deviating from a standard control procedure described below.
- Before taking off, set the stabilizer to flight position +2°, engage the link and then move the stabilizer to take-off position 0° - flaps will be extended to 25°.
- When airborne, move the stabilizer back to flight position (flaps should also fully retract) and unlink these controls.
- Before landing, set the stabilizer to flight position +2°, engage the link and then move the stabilizer to landing position -1.5° - flaps will be fully extended to 40°.
- Airplane tail wheel rotates freely and does not have a lock. For this reason, it is necessary to confidently and accurately operate the rudder pedals during the takeoff and landing.
- Airplane has separate pneumatic wheel brakes. To brake left or right wheels, move their corresponding left or right engine throttle to 20% or less. Setting the central engine throttle to 20% or less will brake both wheels. Maximum braking efficiency can be achieved by moving the trottle all the way down. In the sim, you can also use the brake buttons to move left and right engine throttles to braking position.
- Airplane is equipped with a hydraulic tail wheel parking brake system.
- Airplane is equipped with two mechanical fuel float level gauges for left and right fuel tank groups, located on the left and right engine nacelles outside the cabin.
