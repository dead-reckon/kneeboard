Due to the weak force of the actuator the extended landing flaps may be pressed upwards by the airflow if the airspeed is more than 250 km/h. Remember that the flaps will not extend fully in case of high speed. In case of a high-speed landing approach the flaps may extend a few steps further right before landing.
- Airplane has a manual control for the tailwheel lock. The unlocked tailwheel has a 90° turn limit. The tailwheel should be locked when taxiing straight for a long distance and before takeoff and landing.

- In addition to the automatic single stage supercharger, the engine is equipped with a turbocharger that the pilot can control.
- The turbocharger is powered by the engine exhaust back pressure which can be set by a lever in the cockpit and maintained automatically using the throttle shutters on the exhaust pipes.
- The air compressed in the turbocharger goes to the intercooler where it is cooled by the incoming airflow. The cool compressed air goes to the carburetor and the resulting fuel-air mixture goes to the supercharger.
- The temperature of the air after the intercooler is indicated by a separate gauge. The pilot can control the intercooler flaps using the toggle switch and observe their position using the indicator on the left. Their default position is neutral (50%).
- The turbocharger RPM is controlled by the lever in the cockpit ("T" and "+"/"-" keys by default). At the back lever position the throttle shutters are fully open and exhaust gases all go to the atmosphere, resulting in minimal turbocharger RPM. At the forward lever position, the exhaust back pressure and the resulting turbocharger RPM are at maximum. It should be noted that the RPM will change with the altitude even if the lever is kept in the same position. The turbocharger RPM is indicated by a dedicated gauge; in addition, the signal lamp will light up if the maximum RPM limit is exceeded.

- Air cooling intake shutters should always be open. They should only be closed when there is a possibility of engine overcooling, for example in a dive with idle throttle.
- Aircraft is equipped with elevator and rudder trimmers.
- Airplane has automatic wing slats. They deploy when the high angle of attack increases which makes pre-stall softer.
- Landing flaps have a hydraulic actuator and they can be extended to any angle up to 60°.
- Airplane tail wheel rotates freely and does not have a lock. For this reason, it is necessary to confidently and accurately operate the rudder pedals during the takeoff and landing.
- Airplane has differential pneumatic wheel brakes with shared control lever. This means that if the brake lever is held and the rudder pedal the opposite wheel brake is gradually released causing the plane to swing to one side or the other.
- Airplane has a fuel gauge which shows total remaining fuel.
- Also, it is impossible to open or close canopy at high speed due to strong airflow. The canopy has no emergency release, so bail out requires the speed drop before it.

## Yak-1(b) series 127
- Engine has a two-stage mechanical supercharger which must be manually switched at 2300m altitude.

Due to the weak force of the actuator the extended landing flaps may be pressed upwards by the airflow if the airspeed is more than 220 km/h. Remember that the flaps will not extend fully in case of high speed. In case of a high-speed landing approach the flaps may extend a few steps further right before landing.
- Airplane has a tailwheel control system which is unlocked by the rudder if the rudder pedal is pressed more than 75% of its range. The tailwheel remains locked if pedals are deflected less than 75%. Because of this, it is necessary to avoid large rudder pedal inputs when moving at high speed.
- Airplane has differential pneumatic wheel brakes with shared control lever. This means that if the brake lever is held and the rudder pedal the opposite wheel brake is gradually released causing the plane to swing to one side or the other.

- It is impossible to open or close the canopy at high speed due to strong airflow. The canopy has no emergency release, so bail out requires the speed drop before it.
- The control system for the wing-mounted bomb racks only allows releasing of both bombs together.

## Ju 52/3m g4e
- Engine has a single stage mechanical supercharger which does not require manual control.
- Engine mixture control is manual; it is necessary to lean the mixture if altitude is more than 1 km for optimal engine operation. Also, leaning the mixture allows a reduction in fuel consumption during flight.
- All three propellers are fixed pitch ones, so thrust can only be controlled by adjusting the engines throttle (from idle at 25% to maximum power at 100%). 0 - 20% throttle range is used for braking the landing gear wheels. Engine modes can be determined only by watching the engine RPM gauges.
- Radiator bypass valve and engine cowls are controlled manually.
- Pedals in the cabin are equipped with adjustable load feel mechanism to reduce the pilot's work load.

- The mechanical flaps control system can be controlled simultaneously with the horizontal stabilizer, these two systems can be linked or unlinked (by using flaps control buttons). It is important to note that it is possible to render the system inoperable so it would not be able to control either the stabilizer or the flaps by deviating from a standard control procedure described below.
- Before taking off, set the stabilizer to flight position +2°, engage the link and then move the stabilizer to take-off position 0° - flaps will be extended to 25°.
